<p class="message">
	Note for recruiters, I appreaciate any interest in me and by all means add me as a contact on
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/solrevdev">Linked In</a> but do note I am now a full-time carer and am not in a position to take on any roles at the moment. I am keeping as busy in terms of side projects in order to keep fresh so feel free to check out my GitHub account or profiles.
</p>

## Overview

I am now a full-time carer but was a software developer and DevOps engineer with a wealth of technical skills and started working as a developer in the late 1990's and am Microsoft certified.

A lover of C# but not tied to exclusively the Microsoft stack. 

I switch between writing code in Xamarin Studio, Sublime Text and Visual Studio. I enjoy full stack development, DevOps and cloud-based work in both hands on and head of infrastructure roles both of which I find very rewarding. 

Commercially I have worked with the Amazon Web Services stack, MongoDB, Memcached, GIT, Mercurial, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy and various other technologies and thrive in providing startups with a scalable continuous deployment architecture and platform.
