<p class="message">	
Note for recruiters, I appreciate any interest in me and by all means, add me as a contact on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/solrevdev">Linked In</a> but do note I am now a full-time carer and am not in a position to take on any roles at the moment. I am keeping myself very busy in terms of side projects in order to keep fresh so feel free to check out my GitHub account or profiles.
</p>

## Overview


I am now a full-time carer but until recently have been head of infrastructure and operations, a full stack software engineer and a devops engineer. 

With a wealth of technical skills I am also Microsoft certified.

A lover of C# but not tied to exclusively the Microsoft stack and have enjoyed writing some cloud automation code in Python. 

Currently, I am a big fan of the .NET Core cross-platform development platform and take an interest in docker and serverless architectures. 

I write code in Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text and the full Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Likewise, I also like to switch between macOS, Windows and Linux. 

I enjoy full stack development, devops and cloud-based work and am enjoying writing front end code in VueJS and ReactJS.

Commercially I have recently worked with the Amazon Web Services stack, MySql, MongoDB, Memcached, GIT, Mercurial, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy and various other technologies and thrive in providing startups with a scalable continuous deployment architecture and platform.
