## Overview

I'm a full stack software and DevOps engineer with a rich array of technical skills. Formerly the Head of Infrastructure and Operations, I hold Microsoft certification.

Though I have a fondness for C#, I'm not limited to the Microsoft stack. I've enjoyed writing cloud automation code in Python and NodeJS.

Currently, I'm a strong advocate for the .NET Core cross-platform development platform, constantly seeking new knowledge through reading and watching relevant content.

I employ a variety of tools for my work, including Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and the comprehensive Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Likewise, I'm versatile in operating systems, comfortable with macOS, Windows, and Linux.

My interests span full stack development, DevOps, and cloud-based work. Lately, I've been engrossed in writing front-end code in Vue.js and VanillaJS.

In commercial settings, I've worked with a range of technologies including the Amazon Web Services stack, MySQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, C#, ASP.NET, Classic ASP, GIT, Mercurial, TeamCity, and Octopus Deploy. I thrive in equipping startups with scalable, continuous deployment architecture and platforms
