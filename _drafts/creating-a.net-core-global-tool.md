I have now built my first .NET Core Global Tool!  

**Overview** ‚òÄ

A .NET Core Global Tool is special NuGet package that contains a console application that is installed globally on your machine and is installed in a default directory that is added to the PATH environment variable. 

You can invoke the tool from any directory on the machine without specifying its location.

**The Application** üå±

So, rather than the usual _Hello World_ example to install as a global tool I wanted a tool that would be useful to me. 

I wanted to build a tool that will create a folder named after either a Trello card reference or the current Date in a YYYY-MM-DD format followed by the folder name and to then also copy some default standard dotfiles over in that folder

For example:

`MO-818_create-dotnet-tool`

`2020-09-29_create-dotnet-tool`

It will also copy the following dotfiles over:

* .dockerignore
* .editorconfig
* .gitattributes
* .gitignore
* .prettierignore
* .prettierrc
* omnisharp.json

I won't explain how this code was written; you can view the [source code](https://github.com/solrevdev/seedfolder "source code") over at GitHub to understand how this was done. 

The important thing to note is that the application is a standard .NET Core console application that you can create as follows: 

```powershell
dotnet new console -n yourconsoleapp
```

**Metadata** üìñ

What sets a standard .NET Core console application and a global tool apart is some important metadata in the \`.csproj\` file.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
