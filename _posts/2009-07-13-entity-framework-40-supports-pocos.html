<p>Not really been keeping an eye on Microsoft’s Entity Framework as I think that earlier versions didn’t really support the notion of <a
        href="http://www.jnsk.se/weblog/posts/pocoorpi.htm" target="_blank">persistence ignorance</a> and <a href="http://www.jnsk.se/weblog/posts/pocoorpi.htm"
        target="_blank">Plain Old C# Objects</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gunnarpeipman/archive/2009/07/11/entity-framework-4-0-how-to-use-pocos.aspx" target="_blank">That seems to have changed in
        the upcoming version 4.</a></p>
<p>Still not convinced that the Entity Framework is going to any better than some of the other ORM’s out there. That said I am still sore from having to work
    with the typed Dataset visual designer from Microsoft in earlier versions of Visual Studio…</p>
