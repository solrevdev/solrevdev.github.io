I have been extremely busy recently with, well, pretty much everything, including this week's marathon training schedule on top of caring for mum and an upcoming visit to the Oxord John Radcliffe hospital with her. 

So, I have been working on various things code wise and have a few blog posts in either Trello as ideas or as draft posts which I will push out soon. 

To hold myself accountable I will list a roadmap of these posts in no particular order: 

* Adding SSL/HTTPS to this site. Why and how including options such as CloudFlare, Amazon Certificate Manager and Route53 DNS. 

* Travis-CI for building and pushing these Jekyll driven sites to perhaps Amazon S3 hosting or others apart from my current GitHub Hosting. 

* Setting up TeamCity, Octopus Deploy and FluentMigrator for CI for non static sites after a few years away from this ecosystem. 

*ScriptCS and Rosyln for extending applications and an alternative to Powershell plus it's cross platform

* Push notifications and how I hate email again. 

* Another post about sleep and training and how it helps in life and helps to code.

That is actually just the ones I can be bothered to copy and paste now as its late and I need my beauty sleep!
