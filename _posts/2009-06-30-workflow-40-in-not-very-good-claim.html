<p>Windows Workflow is one piece of the Microsoft .NET stack that has interested me in terms of being able to build workflow based projects based on built in .NET technology however the 3.0 version had too much of a steep learning curve for my patience threshold to spend much of my time on.</p>  <p>So I thought I would wait for the 3.5 version, then I heard rumours that it would be completely re-written for the 4.0 version so I would wait for the 4.0 version.</p>  <p>So this morning I read my first review of the 4.0 version and <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/kathleen/archive/2009/06/28/workflow-4-0-is-disappointing.aspx" target="_blank">it seems itâ€™s not shaping up to be that good</a>. </p>
