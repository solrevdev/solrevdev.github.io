So everytime there is a new version of iTunes I always have to fix an sqlite3 error. So to tell help me and anyone else with the same issue here is the solution I found on the following helpful page: <br /><br />First the error is "The procedure entry point sqlite3_wal_checkpoint could not be located in the dynamic link library SQLite3.dll."<br /><br />And the fix: <a href="http://blog.hummiesworld.com/2011/10/itunes-sqlite3-dll-error-how-to-fix.html#.Unohd85dWe5">Hummie's World of Digital Scrapbooking Tutorials: iTunes sqlite3 dll error - How to Fix</a>
