Today I was writing a script that would at some stage run `git pull`. 

When I ran the script it paused and displayed the message:

`Enter passphrase for key: 'c/Users/Administrator/.ssh/id_rsa'`

No matter how many times I entered the passphrase windows would not remember it and the prompt would appear again.

So, after some time on google and trial and error, these are the steps that fixed the issue for me.

**Enable the OpenSSH Authentication Agent service and make it start automatically.**

**Add your SSH key to the agent with `ssh-add` at `C:\Users\Administrator\.ssh`.**

**Test git integration by doing a `git pull` from the command line and enter the passphrase**

Enter your passphrase when asked during a `git pull` command.

**Add an environment variable `setx GIT_SSH C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe`**

Once these steps were done all was fine and no prompt came up again.

Success ðŸŽ‰
