But you may not have realized that of late it has become an <i>interesting</i> mess…like Frankenstein's monster.  </p><p>These days there's a lot of disingenuous chatter about how G+ is just a "social layer on top of Google," and was never intended as a direct competitor for Facebook; which is, of course, revisionist nonsense. Two years ago it seemed pretty obvious to just about everyone that G+ was intended, or at least hoped for, as a Facebook killer.  </p><p>Which obviously never happened, not least because Google shot themselves in the foot as they came out of the gate: the tech community of early adopters that could conceivably have become a critical-mass beachhead were the same group who reacted most strongly and negatively to G+'s controversial, divisive, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/24/google-plus-has-a-problem-fear-not-i-have-a-solution/">just plain dumb</a> real-names policy. It wasn't until it became painfully apparent that Facebook had nothing to worry about that G+ pivoted to Plan B, its current status: a thin social veneer atop all of Google's products.  </p><p>Which has been moderately successful. Google Plus is awfully quiet, true, but it's not the ghost town that's often claimed. Some numbers from my pet project <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/">Scanvine</a>, which tracks <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/about">how and where</a> news articles are shared online:  </p><ul>  <li>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/sources">average news article</a> tracked (as of this writing) has been shared/liked 890 times on Facebook, mentioned/retweeted 147 times on Twitter–and shared/+1d a paltry 19 times on Google Plus. That's 2 percent of Facebook. Which is pretty bad (by Google's standards) in terms of overall reach, but probably good enough in terms of accumulating a semi-representative sample of social-media signals to feed the ever-hungry maw of Google's search algorithms.  </li><li>Mind you, this distribution varies quite a bit from source to source. Fully a sixth of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/source/the-verge">The Verge's shares</a> come from G+, compared to 0.1 percent&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/source/upworthy">of Upworthy's</a>. (Similarly, LinkedIn is basically nonexistent for many sources, but is a huge contributor to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/harvard-business-review">the Harvard Business Review</a>. G+ does okay&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/source/techcrunch">on TechCrunch</a>, too, in case you're curious, but what's notable here is the massive outperformance of Twitter.)  </li><li>I've heard rumors that G+ is big in India, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/source/the-times-of-india">the numbers for The Times of India</a> offer at best tepid evidence for that: six shares/story via G+ vs. 137 via Facebook. Better than the overall 2 percent average, but not by much.  </li><li>In general, G+ <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/sources/tech">outperforms</a> for tech sources and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/sources/entertainment">underperforms</a> for, errrrr, let's say "non-tech" ones. Its population seems to be heavily STEM-oriented — or, to quote an anecdotal report from elsewhere, "<a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/107909926350520444591/posts/JkHH9VAjFzT">Google+ loves math</a>." We may tentatively conclude that it <i>has</i> caught the attention of many technically inclined early adopters, but two years on, its use doesn't seem to be expanding much from that core. It's a foothold, not a beachhead.  </li></ul>  <p>So. G+ failed as a Facebook killer, and while it may have attracted enough of a STEM-loving audience to serve as Google's social layer, it isn't exactly setting the rest of the world on fire. What it <i>does</i> do, however, which Facebook mostly doesn't, is serve as a means for aggregating and filtering stories. G+ "Circles" can be coerced into news feeds for a particular type of story; for instance, <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102733870103786741145">Brad Acker</a> shared a "Futurists" circle with me which is a really interesting aggregated source of cutting-edge science/tech news.  </p><p>But even that doesn't quite work right. You can share Circles with other people individually, but there doesn't seem to be any way for me to, for instance, post a link to that "Futurists" circle here so that anyone could subscribe. (Please correct me if I'm wrong; this seems like such an obvious feature that I suspect my flu-ridden state is the reason for my inability to find such a link.)  </p><p>Moreover, I'm using that Circle as a news aggregator, but the posts there are still social — i.e. they're built around people, with smiling-face icons and commentary and so forth — when actually I really just want to use it asocially. I mostly don't know or care about the people who are posting to it; I'm just interested in the links they're aggregating. The rest is distracting noise. <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, for all its ugliness, gets this right. G+ does not.  </p><p>Circles are still really useful for all kinds of things, from small-group conversations to project-oriented discussions to news aggregators that nothing else can quite match–but at the same time, they suffer from G+'s attempt to be all things to all people. Admirable ambition, but unless your UX design is superb, you wind up seeming like a bundle of individually good ideas bolted together awkwardly into a shambling mess. Like Frankenstein.  </p><p>But that's not actually the criticism it may seem. People tend to think of Boris Karloff's portrayal of a brute monster: but Mary Shelley's original novel had the subtitle <i>The Modern Prometheus</i>, and its creation was eloquent, educated, and intelligent, but unfairly rejected by most of the world because of his physical deformities and inability to fit in. Alas, I fear the same may be true of Google Plus.  <br>  </p><div>         </div>  </div>  <br>  <div class="visit">  <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/z33nojRSgbM/">Visit website</a>  </div>  </div>  <div class="footer" style="">  Sent via <a href="http://bit.ly/SA6Efh">feedly</a> // A news reader for creative minds.  </div>    </div>
