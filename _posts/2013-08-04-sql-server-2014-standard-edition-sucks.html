We get less CPU power, less memory, and few (if any) new features.  </p><p>According to Microsoft, if you want to use more than <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100007952%20600336949&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;name=64GB%20%284%20x%2016GB%29">$500 worth of memory</a> in your server, you have to step up to Enterprise Edition. Seriously? Standard Edition licensing costs about $2,000 <em>per CPU core</em>, but it <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645993(v=sql.120).aspx">can only access 64GB of memory</a>? That's ridiculous.  </p><p>Take just a quick glance at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645993(v=sql.120).aspx">SQL Server 2014 edition feature grid</a> and you might be shocked at what Standard Edition doesn't allow:  </p><ul>  <li><span>Database snapshots (a huge lifesaver when doing deployments)</span>  </li><li>Online reindexing, parallel index operations (wouldn't you like to use more than one core?)  </li><li>Transparent database encryption (because only enterprises store personally identifiable data or sell stuff online, right?)  </li><li>Auditing (guess only enterprises need compliance)  </li><li>Tons of BI features (because hey, your small business doesn't have intelligence)  </li><li><span>Any non-deprecated high availability feature (no AlwaysOn Availability Groups – you get database mirroring, but that's marked for death)</span>  </li></ul>  <p>Every now and then, I hear managers and DBAs react with shock about how limited Standard is, and how much Enterprise Edition costs – $7,000 per CPU core.  </p><p>Sometimes they even say, "That's ludicrous! If I was Microsoft, there's no way I would do it that way. And we've got really savvy developers – I bet we could even write a database engine that could do most of what we need."  </p><p>Okay, big shot. Time to put your money where your mouth is.  </p><p>The world is full of open source databases that are <em>really good</em>. You're not the only ones frustrated with what Microsoft's done to SQL Server licensing, and there's vibrant developer communities hard at work building and improving database servers.  </p><p>What's that, you say? You're too busy? You'd rather keep paying support on your current SQL Server, and keep working on incremental performance improvements to your code and indexes?  </p><p>Yep, that's what I thought.  </p><p>Microsoft won't change its tack on SQL Server licensing until you start leaving. Therefore, I need you to stop using SQL Server so they'll start making it better. You know, for <strong><em>me</em></strong>.  </p><p><strong>Update July 30th:</strong>: there's a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6124745">good discussion at HackerNews</a> about this post, and I've been participating. DBAs – if you want to stay current on what startup developers think about databases for their new projects, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HackerNews</a> is a good reality check. It's a completely different perspective than the typical enterprise developer echo chamber.  </p><p>...<br><i>Thousands of people can&#39;t be wrong - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BrentOzar">subscribe to our YouTube channel</a>.<br>(Well, except for those people who use Microsoft Access as a database.
