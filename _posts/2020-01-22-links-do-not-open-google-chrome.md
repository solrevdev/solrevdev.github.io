A quick one today.

Sometimes I will click on a link in an external application such as Mail.app (I am careful where these links come from of course!) and nothing will happen. 

Well, Google Chrome will launch if it was closed when I clicked the link however the URL I clicked will not open.  

Nothing, no new tab. nothing.

The fix before was to re-install Google Chrome but today I found this quick solution.

In Chrome's URL bar enter this...

```
chrome://restart
```


This will restart all the Google Chrome processes and will generally fix this issue for a while.

Success ðŸŽ‰.
