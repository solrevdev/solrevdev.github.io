## Exclude all hits from known bots and spiders

Today I decided to take a look at my Google Analytics for this website and I had way more traffic than as site like this ought to have. 

Drilling down into the stats I noticed that most of the traffic must be from either bots or spiders.

Google Analytics does have a setting thought to filter those out. 

Login to your analytics and go to View Settings where there will be a `Exclude all hits from known bots and spiders` checkbox. 

Make sure that is checked.
