Today I decided to take a look at my [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) for this website and I had way more traffic than a site like mine ought to have.

Drilling down into the stats I noticed that most of the traffic must be from either bots or spiders.

Google Analytics does have a setting though to filter those out.

Log in to your analytics and go to `View Settings` where there will be a `Exclude all hits from known bots and spiders` checkbox.

Make sure that is checked.
