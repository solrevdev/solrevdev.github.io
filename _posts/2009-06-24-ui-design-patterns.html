<p>While I am more of a developer than a designer, I do care about the user interface to applications as quite often it does not matter how clever or beautiful you business logic, data access layer and database schema are if the end user does not like using your application or does not like the look of it then the whole project can be deemed a failure. </p>  <p>The UI layer is just as important as the rest of the application if not more so. </p>  <p>Quite often I use design patterns in my code to solve problems and itâ€™s nice to know that there are common UI design patterns as well. </p>  <p>Today I read a great article that lists some <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/23/10-ui-design-patterns-you-should-be-paying-attention-to/" target="_blank">common UI patterns</a>, I especially like the Lazy Registration pattern.</p>
