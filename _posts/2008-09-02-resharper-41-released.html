<p>Jet Brains have a minor point release to one of my favourite productivity tools ReSharper. </p>
<p>Since installing it I have noticed that my memory footprint for devenv.exe is much much smaller and the whole IDE and coding experience feels noticeably
    snappier with Visual Studio.NET 2008 SP1.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will notice the same benefits when I next switch back to coding with Visual Studio.NET 2005.</p>
<p>For further details on the release you can visit the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/releaseNotes41.html">release notes</a> page on the Jet
    Brains site.</p>
