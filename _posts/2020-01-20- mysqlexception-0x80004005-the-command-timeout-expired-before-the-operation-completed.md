**MySqlException (0x80004005): The Command Timeout expired before the operation completed**

Tonight has all been about trying to get rid of some ASP.Net MVC yellow screens of death (YSOD) caused by MySQL timing out.

**Background**

My application is a fairly old ASP.Net MVC 5 web application that used to talk to a local instance of MySQL and now has been ported the cloud (AWS) with the MySQL database migrated to use Amazon's [Aurora Serverless MySQL database service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/). 

I have a few of these now. They suit certain workloads and my dev environments very well.

**Timeouts**

A page in my application is quite query heavy which wasn't a problem but would just take a little while to load. After migrating to the AWS Aurora Serverless MySQL database I started to get some intermittent timeouts.

I would get either:

`MySqlException (0x80004005): The Command Timeout expired before the operation completed`

```

**Solution**

After a quick google I was able to improve the situation for the *(0x80004005): The Command Timeout* exception by telling the [MySQLConnector.NET](https://mysqlconnector.net/) driver to increase the timeout by appending this to the connection string where the timeout is in seconds:

`default command timeout=120`

As I also use [ServiceStack.OrmLite](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite) to talk to my data layer I could instead have added `OrmLiteConfig.CommandTimeout = 120;` in my code but apending to the web.config seemed a neater solution.

That left the rare but repeatable *A connection attempt failed because the connected party...* timeout error, then when looking at some other code that talks to AWS Aurora MySQL Serverless databases I noticed the connection strings had this little gem:

`SslMode=none`

So I decided to try that by appending that to my connection string and it seems to have worked!

**Success?!**

Perhaps its an Amazon Aurora Serverless database oddity or perhaps the bug will still re-appear but for now adding `SslMode=none` to my connection string seems to have worked.

So, this for others and for me in the future is the full connection string I ended up using when connecting to an [AWS Aurora Serverless MySQL database service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/):

```xml
<add key="MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING_RDS" value="Uid=userid;Password=pass;Server=auroa-mysql-rds.cluster-random.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com;Port=3306;Database=dbname;default command timeout=120;SslMode=none" />
```

Success ðŸŽ‰
