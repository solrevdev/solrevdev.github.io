The start-up and performance seems good for now. Certainly no slower than VS2008. The UI was apparently written in WPF which is the first commercial application that I have seen that has been written in WPF.</p> <p></p> <p>That&#8217;s enough for this post as I have a couple of projects that I am working on that I can test this new version on as well as testing out a few &#8220;File New&#8221; projects.</p> <p></p> <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/try/default.mspx">Download Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Beta now.</a></p>   <p style="font-size: 10px;"> <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>  from <a href="http://solrev.posterous.com/microsoft-visual-studio-2010-beta">solution revolution</a> </p> </div>
