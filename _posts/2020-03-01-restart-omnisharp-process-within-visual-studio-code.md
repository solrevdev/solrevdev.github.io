Another quick one for today, Every now and again my intellisense gets confused in Visual Studio Code displaying errors and warnings that should not exist.

The fix for this is to restart the Omnisharp process.

So first off get the commmand pallette up:

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>

Then type:

`>omnisharp:restart omnisharp`

Everything should then go back to normal.

Success ðŸŽ‰
