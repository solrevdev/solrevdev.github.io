<p>On a <a href="http://blog.odeworld.co.uk/" target="_blank">project</a> I worked on recently the team used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29" target="_blank">SCRUM</a> methodology for building the software. </p>  <p>Scrum is just one of the many flavours of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank">agile software development</a> and for the most part it worked really well. </p>  <p>The easy side of any agile project for me are all the good things such as getting the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/treesurgeon" target="_blank">development tree</a> setup in source control, getting a <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET" target="_blank">continuous integration server</a> working and practicing techniques such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a> with tools such as <a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php" target="_blank">NUnit</a>, <a href="http://www.testdriven.net/" target="_blank">TestDriven.NET</a>, <a href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx" target="_blank">RhinoMocks</a>, <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">Selenium</a>  and <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">NAnt</a>.</p>  <p>What wasn't quite as easy for the team was the writing of user stories, these are better than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front" target="_blank">BDUP</a> specification documents but are still not a walk in the park to get right.</p>  <p>This is still something that I try and continue to improve my knowledge on and a couple of articles I've read today that have a slightly different take on user story writing than I've previously read. </p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.derickbailey.com/2008/05/29/UserStoryAndAcceptanceCriteriaFormatting.aspx">User Story And Acceptance Criteria Formatting</a></li>    <li><a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/06/13/My-BDD-experiment.aspx">My BDD experiment</a></li>    <li><a href="http://iansrobinson.com/2008/06/05/rediscovering-business-benefits/">Rediscovering Business Benefits </a></li> </ul>  <p><img alt="music note" src="http://spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/music_note.gif" align="absmiddle" border="0" width="14" height="14" /> While writing this, I was listening to "Web 2.0 - Part 2 of 3" by ThoughtWorks</p>
