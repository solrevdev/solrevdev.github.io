<p>Today at the Gym I caught up with some podcasts and listened to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcast170KanbanBoardsForAgileProjectManagementWithZenAuthorNateKohari.aspx" target="_blank">Hanselminutes Podcast 170 – Kanban Boards for Agile Project Management with Zen Author Nate Kohari</a>.</p>  <p>This approach to lean management of software projects is very interesting and differs from the SCRUM time boxed approach that I have worked with before. </p>  <p>I have decided to give this approach a go with a side project I have been meaning to work on and have signed up for the free account over at the <a href="http://agilezen.com/" target="_blank">Zen Project Management site</a>.</p>  <p>For a bit more of an overview on Kanban head over to <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Kanban-Systems.html" target="_blank">James Shore’s overview on Kanban systems</a>.</p>
