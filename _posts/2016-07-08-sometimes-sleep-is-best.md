I had planned to crack open the laptop but after a day of looking after my mum, fighting with the first instance of malware on my Macbook Pro and a tiring kettlebell session I am pleased that I managed to get some refreshing sleep instead. 

Ever since I taught myself how to code back in the 1990's I have had issues with sleep so I am so pleased I managed to sleep again. Sleep is coming easier the more I train. 

The malware was I suspect from a chrome extension and removing that and installing again seems to have worked. 

The malware was a variant of VpnApps and neither [Sophos](https://www.sophos.com/en-us.aspx) or [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) could shift it. 

Oh well, today a fresh day and have sleep behind me as the image from my [Gyroscope app](https://gyrosco.pe/) shows.
