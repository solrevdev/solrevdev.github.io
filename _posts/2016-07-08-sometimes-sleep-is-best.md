I had planned to crack open the laptop but after a day of looking after my mum, fighting with the first time ive had malware on my mac and a tiring kettlebell session i am pleased that i managed to get some refreshing sleep instead. 

Ever since I taught myself how to code back in the 1990's i have had issues with sleep so i am so pleased i managed to sleep again. Sleep is coming easier the more i train. 

The malware was i suspect from a chrome extension and removing that and installing again seems to have worked. 

The malware was the VpnApps one and neither Sophos or Antimalware Bytes could shift it. 

Oh well today a fresh day and have sleep behind me as the image from my Gyroscope app shows.
