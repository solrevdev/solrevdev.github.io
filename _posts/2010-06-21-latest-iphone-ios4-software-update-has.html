<div class='posterous_autopost'>        <p>Have just downloaded and tried to install the latest iOS4 operating system from Apple but the result was not quite the seamless smooth upgrade that I had hoped for: </p> <p></p> <p><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/solrev/TRQd2h7HcswYP8i3JX4cq7XCQKNoMoVY7T6RlADdQ7zaGVg9mBCt8a1BqDzu/image001.png" width="408" height="121"/> </p> <p></p> <p>I am hoping that I can get it back to a working state and restore all my mail settings because at the moment its useless. </p> <p></p> <p>I wonder if anyone else has had the same problem? Microsoft wouldn&#8217;t get away with this.</p> <p></p> <p>Harrumph</p>  <p style="font-size: 10px;"> <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>  from <a href="http://solrev.posterous.com/latest-iphone-ios4-software-update-has-killed">solution revolution</a> </p> </div>
