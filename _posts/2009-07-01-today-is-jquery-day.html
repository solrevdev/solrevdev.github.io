<p>The more I use jQuery the more I like it but one thing that would really help is intellisense in Visual Studio. Well that is actually possible it seems after <a href="http://webdevdotnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/aspnet-mvc-jquery-part-1-adding-jquery.html" target="_blank">reading a really helpful post that explains how to actually make that happen.</a></p>  <p>The <a href="http://webdevdotnet.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">same guy</a> that wrote that post (whoâ€™s RSS feed has now been added to my every expanding Google Reader subscriptions list) has also written a cool post that <a href="http://webdevdotnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/aspnet-mvc-jquery-part-2-zebra-striping.html" target="_blank">explains how to use jQuery to give tables the striped alternating row colour effect known as zebra striping</a>. </p>  <p>Its a technique I have used with both server side C# or JavaScript in the past but jQuery cuts down the amount of code to a <a href="http://webdevdotnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/aspnet-mvc-jquery-part-2-zebra-striping.html" target="_blank">couple of lines of JavaScript</a>.</p>  <p>Another good read is a post on how to create the share a page with various social networking sites such as facebook or digg etc. <a href="http://www.queness.com/post/309/create-a-digg-style-post-sharing-tool-with-jquery" target="_blank">This excellent tutorial again uses jQuery to achieve this</a>.</p>
