<p>The company credit card has been dusted off again and this time to upgrade my ReSharper license from the older 2.x version to the new 4.x version.</p>  <p>The new version has full support for C# 3.0 and LINQ and has ASP.NET performance improvements.</p>  <p>All of the shortcuts and productivity gains I used in 2.x work in exactly the same way although most of my current projects are built in Visual Studio 2005 so I'm not getting the full benefit of the new version yet.</p>  <p>This will be changing soon as some upcoming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project" target="_blank">greenfield projects</a> will allow me to use Visual Studio 2008, <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> and many other cool new things!</p>  <p>I am going to print out the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/docs/ReSharper40DefaultKeymap.pdf" target="_blank">keyboard shortcut cheatsheet pdf</a> and stick it above my desk.</p>  <p><img alt="music note" src="http://spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/music_note.gif" align="absmiddle" border="0" width="14" height="14" /> While writing this, I was listening to "Sorting out Internationalization with Michael Kaplan" by Scott Hanselman</p>
