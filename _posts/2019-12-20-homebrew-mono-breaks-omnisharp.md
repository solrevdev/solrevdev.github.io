So today, I raised a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/3477) because after I had opened the result of `dotnet new mvc` in VSCode the problems window would have approximately 120 issues and the code editor window would be full of red squiggles.

I was running the very [latest version of dotnetcore](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)

And the very latest version of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I had not changed anything in the .csproj file. It was fresh from running `dotnet new mvc` from the terminal.

So, I raised an issue over on [GitHub](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/3477).

Big thanks to the rapid response and answer from [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw), who discovered that it was the [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [cellar](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook) version of mono that was the issue and that intstalling the [stable version of mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) was the fix.
