I do have a blog post roadmap but each post idea does involve a level of research and thought and seeing as it is 2:30am here in the UK and well lets just say I wanted a quick post created on my mobile phone involving little thinking. Well firstly this post when listed on the home page used ro render the entire post.

Jekyll does have excerpts but they didn't work as I wanted to but I should have resolved that.

However all being well,  This paragraph will not be on the home page. So I used Jekyll variables and used the strip html function and a truncate words setting to show some teasers. 

An advantage of this less html weight on the home page.

Tags and Categories I think were also not setup correctly.  That should now be fixed. 

Finally as I imported all my content from blogger one issue I had was posts created by a tool that added tbe pipe charachter which you either have ro escape or remove as its a reserved character.

This is used on the Archive page. 

Finally this post written just before sleep ans direct in markdown and not spellchecked. 
 
Cheers!
