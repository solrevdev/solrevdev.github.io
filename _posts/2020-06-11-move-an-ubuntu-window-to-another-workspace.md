Last night I decided to pull the trigger and upgrade from [Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/19.10/) to [Ubuntu Focal Fossa 20.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)

A fairly smooth upgrade all in all.

I did have to re-enable the .NET Core APT repository using the following command:

```powershell
sudo apt-add-repository https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/prod
```

I also discovered a neat shortcut to move programs from one workspace to another:

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow key</kbd>

I hope this will soon become muscle memory ðŸ’ª !

Success ðŸŽ‰
