<p>Rob Conery has posted a <a href="http://subsonicproject.com/docs/Using_SimpleRepository" target="_blank">video and a blog post</a> explaining one the cooler
    features of the new Subsonic 3.0 ORM product which is the Simple Repository that can also create the database schema on the fly as you drive out the domain
    model of your application.</p>
<p>I think this has pretty much convinced me to use <a href="http://subsonicproject.com" target="_blank">subsonic</a> in the side project I am working on
    alongside <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">GIT</a> and <a href="http://agilezen.com" target="_blank">Kanban</a>.</p>
