<p>This morning I read a <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2009/06/29/how-we-do-mvc-view-models.aspx" target="_blank">very interesting blog post about view model design</a> within the context of building an application with the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC framework. </p>  <p>The concept of the view model isn't baked into the Microsoft MVC framework. <a href="http://blogs.imeta.co.uk/HHariri/archive/2009/05/07/asp.net-mvc-quotmodelsquot-the-lonesome-folder.aspx" target="_blank">In fact the entire model part of model view controller is left entirely up to the developer</a>. </p>  <p>This isn't a criticism at all as the ASP.NET MVC framework is still at version 1.0 and is one the best web based things to come out of Microsoft for ages.</p>  <p>Anyhoo. <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2009/06/29/how-we-do-mvc-view-models.aspx" target="_blank">Its worth a read</a>.</p>
