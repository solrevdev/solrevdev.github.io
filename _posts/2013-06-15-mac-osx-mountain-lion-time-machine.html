Now this has happened to me enough times that it needs to be blogged about so that when I suffer with it again I can come back to these hacks to try and resolve it again.<br><br>So on Friday evening I started off my Time Machine back up and today Saturday evening it had only backed up 1.5GB of the 13GB I wanted it to.<br><br>24 hours should be plenty to back this amount of data up!<br><br>My setup is as follows:<br><ul><li>MackBook Pro connected via ethernet (WIFI connection good but ethernet better for backups)<br></li><li>Western Digital MyBookLive NAS connected via ethernet.<br></li><li>All up to date in terms of Mountain Lion updates and MyBookLive firmware</li></ul><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KQ6Yj8qsxwc/UbzUR32J27I/AAAAAAAAAEU/gjo0zv9Rd-k/s1600/macbook-specs.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img alt="macbook specs" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KQ6Yj8qsxwc/UbzUR32J27I/AAAAAAAAAEU/gjo0zv9Rd-k/s320/macbook-specs.png" title="macbook specs"></a></div></div><div><br></div><div>So in order to fix this I tried the following, one of these worked. No idea which one although I suspect the reboot into safe mode then restart is the magic here.</div><div><ul><li>Open a command prompt and type without quotes "sudo tmdiagnose" and wait for it to complete.<br></li><li>In a web browser open up <a href="http://mybooklive.local/">http://mybooklive.local</a>&nbsp;and login to the western digital drive.<br></li><li>Turn off the twonky media service if you don't use it.<br></li><li>Turn off remote access if you do not need it.<br></li><li>Turn off the energy saver checkbox so the hard disk does not go to sleep.<br></li><li>Reboot the western digital drive just in case. if in doubt turn things off then back on again.<br></li><li>Ensure your mac is not indexing the local disk by checking spotlight. if it is wait for it to finish.<br></li><li>And now I think the magic. shutdown your mac via the apple logo then after a minute....<br></li><li>Turn on the mac holding down the <b>shift</b> key so that it <b>boots into safe mode</b>.<br></li><li>Stare at the screen for a while then reboot your mac.<br></li><li>Start time machine backup again.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div>And then to my relief my time machine backup over ethernet process zoomed along and I saw this screen within about an hour which is much more acceptable.<br><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ngBerzu2kW4/UbzV-m9-q8I/AAAAAAAAAEs/DBNhOOslCaw/s1600/time-machine-cleanup.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="time-machine-cleaning-up" border="0" height="272" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ngBerzu2kW4/UbzV-m9-q8I/AAAAAAAAAEs/DBNhOOslCaw/s400/time-machine-cleanup.png" title="time-machine-cleaning-up" width="400"></a></div><br></div>Now all I need to work out is to back up my Western Digital NAS to Amazon's Glacier storage. I think I'll leave that for another weekend...
