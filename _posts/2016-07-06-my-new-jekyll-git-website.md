## New website


So, I have had a blog for quite a long time and have hosted it on various platforms such as [Posterous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous), [Passle](https://home.passle.net/), [Amazon AWS S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) and finally ended up on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/home). 

I have also hosted it under various domain names before settling on the one you are on now. 

I decided to refresh the website and blog and wanted to have control of my content so I decided to [import my blogger posts with Jekyll](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/) and am storing the content in [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and it's currently being hosted via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

The Blogger platform despite the nice iOS app is a little dated so I wanted a nice refresh and fast static site so I am really happy with being able to write new blog posts in any text editor I like using the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax and just use `git push` when I have generated the site the new post via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

All in all, I am very happy so far. 

Cheers!
