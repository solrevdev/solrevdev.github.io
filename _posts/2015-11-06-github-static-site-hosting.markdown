title: GitHub blog hosting and static site generation

My blog has moved platforms quite a bit over the years and is currently hosted on blogger and was previously with a company and app that is no longer with us. 

I have a lot of posts and content, and a custom domain and URLs that come up in search engines so moving away from blogger isn't going to be an insignificant task. 

So this is a test post to try out GitHub blog hosting and a foray into the world of static site generation. 

The main blog currently sat on blogger is http://www.solrevdev.com and is very code and technical in nature however I do have boxing and fitness related accounts with a Facebook page, Instagram account, and Twitter account.

Ideally, I would like to keep http://www.solrevdev.com for the technical stuff with all my old content and hopefully, create another static site for my boxing and fitness content.

So, for now, I am just using the intelligent people at https://dnsimple.com/ to redirect http://johnsmithdoesnothaveawebsite.com here and testing https://tinypress.co/,  https://codeanywhere.com/, and https://jekyllrb.com/ to manage posts until I fully import my blog. 

Let's see how this pans out!
