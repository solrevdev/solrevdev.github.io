There are a plethora of changes in the new version, but the two most visible changes are a <strong>"mobile first" responsive grid</strong>&nbsp;and a new <strong>flat graphical style</strong>,&nbsp;ala Windows 8.  </p><p>The flat styling has been especially controversial. If you didn't need to differentiate a site with distinctive design (e.g. internal admin sites), you could usually get away with using previous versions of Bootstrap without any stylistic modification, but not so much with Bootstrap 3.  </p><p>Unfortunately for those uses, the default styling in Bootstrap 3 is fairly bland until you customize it a bit or augment it with a full theme. <a target="_blank" href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a>&nbsp;and <a target="_blank" href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">WrapBootstrap</a> are two great resources to accomplish the latter. To simply bring Bootstrap 3 most of the way back to Bootstrap 2.3.2′s look and feel, there's also an <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/">official theme you can apply</a>.  </p><p>So, I think the brouhaha over flat vs. gradient defaults is overblown. More importantly, that change has had an interesting side-effect that seems to have been mostly overlooked this week: <strong>Performance</strong>.  </p><h3>"Mobile first" means performance is crucial</h3>  <p>In a "mobile first" world, Bootstrap's biggest weakness has always been performance. It's surprising if you haven't delved into the topic before, but the impact of structural choices in a CSS framework can have a tremendous impact on layout and rendering performance – particularly on under-powered mobile devices. Even between pages that look nearly identical, small differences can make or break achieving the all-important 60 FPS draw rate for scrolling and animation.  </p><p>Adobe's relatively bare-bones <a target="_blank" href="http://topcoat.io/">Topcoat framework</a> is a great example of just how much performance you can squeeze out of a mobile browser when that's your primary focus. They even have <a target="_blank" href="http://bench.topcoat.io/">a running benchmark of each build's rendering and layout times</a> as part of their CI workflow. Compared to less-optimized frameworks, the difference in <a target="_blank" href="http://jankfree.org/">jank</a>&nbsp;is stark on slower devices and/or browsers.  </p><p>Coming back to Bootstrap 3, what hasn't been discussed very much this week is that the new release has had a significant impact on rendering performance. To illustrate that,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>&nbsp;used Chrome's dev tools to took a look at the performance difference between Bootstrap 2.3.2 and Bootstrap 3 RC1 a few weeks ago:  </p><p>  </p><p>Pretty impressive.  </p><p>In Bootstrap 3′s case, it's likely that the improvement stems almost entirely from the flat styling, as gradients and shadows are expensive to render. Regardless of the root cause, <strong>Bootstrap 3 is much more viable for sites that need to work well on under-powered mobile and tablet devices</strong>.  </p><hr>  <p>You've been reading <a href="http://encosia.com/the-big-change-in-bootstrap-3-that-no-ones-talking-about/">The big change in Bootstrap 3 that no one's talking about</a>, originally posted at <a href="http://encosia.com">Encosia</a>.
