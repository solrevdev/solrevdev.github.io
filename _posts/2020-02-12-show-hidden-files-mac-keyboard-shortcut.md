A very very quick one today. 

Sometimes when developing on macOS I want to view hidden files in Finder but most of the time it is just extra noise so I like them hidden. 

There is a keyboard shortcut to toggle the visibility of these files. 

<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>

<s>(thanks to [osx daily](http://osxdaily.com/2018/02/12/show-hidden-files-mac-keyboard-shortcut/) for the tip and image.)</s>

This keyboard shortcut will show hidden files or hide them if shown...

Success ðŸŽ‰
