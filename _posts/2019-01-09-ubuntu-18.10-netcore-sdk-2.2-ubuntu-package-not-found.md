This is something I have had to do before so I am blogging here for next time.

I have just upgraded my laptop from Ubuntu 18.04 to 18.10 so that I could check out the latest Gnome desktop environment and one of my first tasks was to update the .net framework to the latest 2.2 sdk.

However despite following the instructions from here: <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/ubuntu18-04/sdk-2.2.102>

```powershell
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb

sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.2
```

I would then receive a package not found error on the ```sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.2``` line.

The fix seems to be to copy these manually.

```powershell
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/prod.list
sudo mv prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
sudo apt update
```

So once I had entered the following all was well. Phew!

I must say the drop in resources and general snappiness with the latest gnome on ubuntu 18.10 is noticeable.  ðŸ™Œ

Success ðŸŽ‰
