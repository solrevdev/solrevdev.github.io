<h1>Amazon Workspaces</h1>So during an insomniac night I had a play with Amazonâ€™s new workspaces feature that provides a fully managed
virtual desktop experience fully controlled from their web based console.<br />Being a long term but ex windows guy now I am quite
interested in the possibilities of pay as you go and more active directory linked virtualised machines now provided by Amazon for testing
and one off tasks but the value for everyone from one man operations to something much larger are clear.<br />They have a very good <a
    href="http://youtu.be/jsqI7KU3S8I">Workspaces intro</a><br /><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/">With more detailed information
    available</a><br />So using the closet data centre to me I created a workspace using the web console by providing a username and email
address and about 20 minutes later it was provisioned and I got the intro email with all the information I needed to connect to my
instance.<br /><img alt="Amazon Workspaces" src="https://i.imgur.com/hEROuel.png" /> <br />Once I followed the instructions and entered the
password I got to download the client from this page<br /><img alt="Various Clients" src="https://i.imgur.com/chzQSD6.png" /> <br />Being on
a mac I downloaded and installed the mac installer and was soon connected to a very fast desktop client machine. <br /><img alt="Mac"

very tired right now. More later on this new and shiny feature.
