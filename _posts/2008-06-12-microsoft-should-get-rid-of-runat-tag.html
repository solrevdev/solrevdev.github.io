<p>I write ASP.NET code most of the time and do so with Microsoft Visual Studio.NET 2003/2005/2008 and it has become really tiresome to add the
    runat=&quot;server&quot; tag all the time!</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind if there were runat=&quot;client&quot; or runat=&quot;pub&quot;&#160; options but there isn't.</p>
<p>So please Microsoft stop us from having to use it!</p>
