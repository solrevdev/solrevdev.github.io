So, when I am at my laptop I can draft a blog post using my text editor of choice using the markdown and commit the file to git. 

Then using Jekyll i can build the static pages and a `git push` will deploy the new post. 

That is a lovely workflow for a developer and keeps me away from wordpress or a heavy content management system. 

However as I am going to host my images on Amazon S3 as that is where my old blogger images used to live I want to upload screenshots from my phone and I want to write a post using a markdown editor and publish on the move

In fact just like this!

I can even embed some code snippets like this:
