<h1>Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac</h1> <p>So while I wait for the latest Xamarin Studio to install and a remote windows machine to restart I thought I would test out Byword as I am a huge Markdown fan and use it for all text that isnt code although thats possible too. </p> <p>I use IA Writer, Mou, Day One and now I am trialling ByWord as it hooks into Blogger and Wordpress and a few more.</p> <img src="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/byword-publishing.png" alt="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/byword-publishing.png" />  <p>I use a Mac these days but for 12 years I was a Microsoft Guy and still need to use Microsoft machines and up until now I have been using the old version that looks like this</p> <img src="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/old-microsoft-remote-desktop.png" alt="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/old-microsoft-remote-desktop.png" />  <p>It sort of worked but now I am using the latest version it&#8217;s a treat to use. Especially on a Thunderbolt display, Go get it now!</p> <p>I&#8217;ll leave the links up to the reader to google as my machines should have restarted now and Xamarin has updated!</p> <img src="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/microsoft-remote-desktop.png" alt="http:///static.solrevdev.com/blog/microsoft-remote-desktop.png" />  <img src="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/about-ms-remote-desktop.png" alt="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/about-ms-remote-desktop.png" />
