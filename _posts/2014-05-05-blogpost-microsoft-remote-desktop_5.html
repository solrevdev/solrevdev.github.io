<h1>Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac</h1>
<p>So while I wait for the latest Xamarin Studio to install and a remote windows machine to restart I thought I would test out Byword as I
    am a huge Markdown fan and use it for all text that isn't code although that's possible too. </p>
<p>I use IA Writer, Mou, Day One and now I am trialling ByWord as it hooks into Blogger and Wordpress and a few more.</p>

<p>I use a Mac these days but for 12 years I was a Microsoft Guy and still need to use Microsoft machines and up until now I have been using
    the old version that looks like this</p>

<p>It sort of worked but now I am using the latest version it's a treat to use. Especially on a Thunderbolt display, Go get it now!</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll leave the links up to the reader to google as my machines should have restarted now and Xamarin has updated!</p>
