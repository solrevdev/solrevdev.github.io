<div class='posterous_autopost'>
    <p>&#8220;Error updating JScript IntelliSense: jquery-1.3.2.min-fds90[1]..js: Object doesn't support this property or method @ 32:399&#8221;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I have the hot fix installed and at some point it has worked but I don&#8217;t think the .vsdoc file plays well with others as the only other thing that
        I can think of is that I use the jQuery UI library along with a table sorting library.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I don&#8217;t really need it but it&#8217;s nagging me to the point of madness not being able to get it working!</p>
