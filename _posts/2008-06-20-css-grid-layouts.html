<p>Today I started to build a new website and have been given the design from the graphic designer along with all the images that are needed to build the site.
</p>
<p>The next step is to turn the design into XHTML and CSS and create a .NET Master Page for this new design. </p>
<p>Some earlier reading and research has pointed me to some nice CSS frameworks that can help me out with this.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/" target="_blank">YUI Grids CSS</a> <br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/"
        target="_blank">Blueprint</a></p>
<p>Both of these frameworks allow you to split up your page into a grid system allowing you to create containers, navigation bars, headers, footers and such
    like and cover all the browser inconsistencies including IE6.</p>
<p>Hopefully using one of these frameworks will give the site a nice consistent look and feel and one that is standards compliant also.</p>
<p>Not sure which one I will use if any but I will post my findings in a future post. </p>
