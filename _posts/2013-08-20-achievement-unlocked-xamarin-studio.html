With more faff than I would like and the odd hour here and there spent over the past few months I now have a nice little starter template running on my Mac that uses Xamarin Studio, mono 3, asp.net mvc4 with razor syntax highlighting combined with the lovely ServiceStack api framework, bootstrap 3 and ember.js running!<div><br></div><div>Now i need a nice little side project to build something with it. I have a cunning plan to use integrate some api's from programmable web and build a mashup of some sort.</div>
