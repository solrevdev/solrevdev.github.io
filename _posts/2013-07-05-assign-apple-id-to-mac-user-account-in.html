<div>      <style>  BODY  {  margin:1em;  font-size: 16px;  background-repeat: repeat;  line-height: 1.5em;  color: #262626;  }  a  {  color: #82BD1A;  }  table { font: inherit; }  .source {  color : #909090;  font-size : 14px;  }  .article  {  padding : 1em;  background-color: #eaeded;  color : #404040;  margin-top : 1.5em;  }  .visit  {  border-radius : 4px;  background-color: #CFCFCF;  text-align : center;  padding : 8px;  }  .visit a  {  text-decoration : none;  color : #666;  }  .header   {  padding-top : 0.3em;  padding-bottom : 1.5em;  font-size : 28px;  line-height : 1.2em;  font-weight : bold;  }  .footer   {  padding-top : 3em;  padding-bottom : 6em;  color : #444444;  text-align : center;  }  </style>      Pretty good tip for mac users like myself. Allows you to recover from forgotten passwords and I have way way too many so this is a good feature,<br>  &nbsp;  <br>  &nbsp;  <div class="article">  <div class="source">  Shared via <a href="http://bit.ly/SA6Efh">feedly</a> // published on OS X Daily // <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/osxdaily/~3/R2D5BWRMYA8/">visit site</a>  </div>  <div class="header">  <b>Assign an Apple ID to a Mac User Account in OS X for Added Peace of Mind</b>  </div>  <div>  <div><p>Many Mac users overlook a feature in OS X that allows them to attach an Apple ID to their actual user account, not just to iCloud and the App Store. It only takes a moment to set, and it provides for an incredibly <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/11/23/forgot-an-os-x-password-reset-it-using-an-apple-id/">simple password recovery option</a> at the login and boot menus, allowing you to regain access to your user account and files just by entering the associated Apple ID.  </p><p>Going further, Macs with <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/12/04/create-new-user-account-mac-os-x/">multiple user accounts</a> can assign different Apple ID's to each unique user account, or you can just choose to tie a single Apple ID to the Mac. If you do choose to attach a lone Apple ID to the Mac this way, be sure to associate it with an administrator (admin) account in OS X, that way you will be able to regain full system access in the event it's needed because the primary password has been lost.  </p><h3>Set Up Apple ID and Associate it with User Accounts in OS X</h3>  <ul>  <li>Open System Preferences, found easily in the  Apple menu  </li><li>Choose the "Users &amp; Groups" panel and select your primary user account from the list  </li><li>Look under the user name to "Apple ID" and click the "Set" button  <p><img title="assign-apple-id-to-mac-account" width="461" alt="Set an Apple ID and attach it to a Mac account" src="http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/assign-apple-id-to-mac-account.jpg" height="212">  </p></li><li>Enter your Apple ID (the same login information as used for iTunes, App Store, and iCloud), then click "OK" to confirm it – users without Apple ID's can create one here too*  <p><img title="set-apple-id-mac-user-account" width="438" alt="Setting an Apple ID to a Mac User account" src="http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/set-apple-id-mac-user-account.jpg" height="142">  </p></li><li>Check the box for "Allow user to reset password using Apple ID" – this is optional, but highly recommended  </li></ul>  <p><img title="allow-apple-id-password-reset" width="599" alt="Allow Apple ID password resets" src="http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/allow-apple-id-password-reset.jpeg" height="454">  </p><p>* If you somehow don't have an Apple ID yet, you can set one up easily by clicking the "Create Apple ID" button. Apple ID's are now tied to just about everything, from iCloud backups and access, to App Store downloads and purchases, to iTunes and the iBookstore, so if you somehow haven't created one yet, do that now.  </p><p>That optional Apple ID-based password reset feature is extremely helpful and as we mentioned, highly recommended, because it allows you to be able to reset a lost password directly from the login screen just by verifying the Apple ID details:  </p><p><img title="reset-password-mac" width="600" alt="Reset a Password in Mac OS X with the Apple ID" src="http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/reset-password-mac.jpg" height="325">  </p><p>This is extraordinarily quick and quite simple for Mac users running Mavericks, Mountain Lion, and Lion, and it prevents the need of the more technical approaches to <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2010/08/10/forgot-mac-password-how-to-reset-mac-password/">resetting forgotten passwords</a> (though those will continue to work as well).  </p><p>This works in OS X Mavericks, OS X Mountain Lion, and OS X Lion, the only requirement is having an active Apple ID. You will obviously need internet access to use this feature as well, since it requires the communication between Apple and the Mac to set the ID and also to be able to access the recovery benefits it offers.  </p></div><div>        </div>  </div>  <br>  <div class="visit">  <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/osxdaily/~3/R2D5BWRMYA8/">Visit website</a>  </div>  </div>  <div class="footer">  Sent via <a href="http://bit.ly/SA6Efh">feedly</a> // A news reader for creative minds.  </div>    </div>
