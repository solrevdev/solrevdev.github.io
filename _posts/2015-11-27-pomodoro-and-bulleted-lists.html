<p>Productivity and moving away from App Todo Lists</p> <p>I have tried them all, every new app or system and always digital. Some better than others and some work well but do not sync across devices or lose data. And I always have the feeling that an analogue (paper!) system might suit me better. </p> <p>At the very least it would not run out of battery and my handwriting since I became a programmer would put a doctor to shame. </p> <p>So after a stressfull week leaving me behind with goals and feeling pressured with everthing I decided to utilise the flow mentioned in one of the posts I am about to link to that will help me get stuff done and feel good about it. </p> <p>The two methods essentially are using the flow that the pomodoro technique will give me</p> <p>http://lifehacker.com/the-bullet-journal-productivity-method-empowers-your-pa&#8211;1169313228</p> <p>And the second here is how to set up a paper todo and project management list on paper </p> <p>https://medium.com/life-learning/how-to-work&#8211;40-hours-in&#8211;16&#8211;7-the-simple-technique-that-gave-me-my-life-back&#8211;8f98ec011862#.crp5szwdq</p>
