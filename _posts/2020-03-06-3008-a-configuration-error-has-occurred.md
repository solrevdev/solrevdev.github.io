A static HTML website I look after is hosted on a Windows Server 2012R2 instance running IIS, it makes use of a `web.config` file as it has some settings that allow this site to be served from behind an Amazon Web Services Elastic Load Balancer.

Today it kept crashing with the thousands of these events in event viewer:

```powershell

The fix was to change the websites application pool to use .NET CLR Version 4 rather than .NET CLR Version 2

So, open **IIS**, choose **Application Pools** from the left-hand navigation, Choose your app pool and click **basic settings** to open the dialog to change which .NET CLR Version to use.

Once this was done the errors stopped and the site stopped crashing

Success ðŸŽ‰
