If you use Google Reader to read my blog, this means you might miss out on my posts and <strong>I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT THIS!</strong> </p>  <p>Then again, maybe this is finally your chance to make a break, get some fresh air, stop reading blogs and start creating! I won't hold it against you. </p><p>But for the rest of you, it's a good time to find a replacement. Or at the very least <a title="Follow Haacked on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/haacked">follow me on Twitter</a> since I do tweet when I blog. </p>  <p>There's a lot of Google Reader replacements out there, but only two that I like so far. </p><h2>Feedly</h2> <p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/AGoogleReaderReplacement_1514B/feedly_2.png"><img border="0" width="504" title="feedly" alt="feedly" src="http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/AGoogleReaderReplacement_1514B/feedly_thumb.png" height="270"></a> </p>  <p><a title="Feedly.com" href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a> is gorgeous. There are apps for many platforms, but the browser works pretty well. Also, you can use Google to log into it and import your Google Reader feeds. I hope Google allows exporting to Feedly and other aggregators after July 1st even as they close down the Google Reader site. </p>  <p>The problem I have with Feedly is that it doesn't work like Google Reader. It wouldn't be so bad if it had a better flow for reading items, but I find its interface to be quirky and in some cases, unintuitive. For example, it seems I have to mark items as read by clicking "mark above articles as read" rather than having it do it automatically like Reader does after you scroll past it. </p>  <p>This leads me toâ€¦ </p><h2>Go Read</h2> <p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/AGoogleReaderReplacement_1514B/go-read_2.png"><img border="0" width="504" title="go-read" alt="go-read" src="http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/AGoogleReaderReplacement_1514B/go-read_thumb.png" height="332"></a> </p>  <p><a title="Go Read" href="http://www.goread.io/">Go Read</a> is a late entry into the list, but there are three important things I really like about it: </p><ol> <li>It is intended to be a clean and simple clone of Google Reader. </li>  <li>It supports Google Reader's keyboard shortcuts. </li><li>It is open source and <a title="goread on github" href="https://github.com/mjibson/goread">up on GitHub</a>! </li></ol> <p>For some more details, check out the <a title="go read" href="http://mattjibson.com/blog/2013/06/26/go-read-open-source-google-reader-clone/">announcement blog post</a> by the author, <a title="Matt Jibson's Blog" href="http://mattjibson.com/">Matt Jibson</a>, a developer at <a title="Stack Exchange" href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>: </p>  <blockquote> <p>I would like to announce the release of <a href="http://www.goread.io/">Go Read</a>. It as a Google Reader clone, and designed to be close to its simplicity and cleanliness. I wanted to build something as close to Google Reader as made sense for one person to build in a few months. </p>  </blockquote> <p>It's basically Google Reader, but without all the cruft and where you can send pull requests to improve things! </p><p>In fact, there's already a few pull requests with some nice user interface polish that should hopefully make it into the site soon. </p>  <p>Despite some false starts, I have it up and running on my machine. I sent a few pull requests to update the README to help other clueless folks like me get it set up for hacking on. </p><p>So check it out, import your Google Reader feeds, and never miss out on another <a href="http://Haacked.com">Haacked.com</a> post EVER!</p>  <div>      </div>  </div>  <br>  <div class="visit">  <a href="http://feeds.haacked.com/~r/haacked/~3/nAFw1GchKug/a-google-reader-replacement.aspx">Visit website</a>  </div>  </div>  <div class="footer">  Sent via <a href="http://bit.ly/SA6Efh">feedly</a> // A news reader for creative minds.  </div>    </div>
