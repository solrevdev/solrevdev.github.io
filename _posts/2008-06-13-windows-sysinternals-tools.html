<p>The Windows Sysinternals team create a superb suite of <a title="system administration utilities" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/0e18b180-9b7a-4c49-8120-c47c5a693683.aspx" target="_blank">system administration utilities</a> which you would normally download and install onto your local machine. </p>  <p>This suite of tools includes a replacement for the windows task manager called <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank">Process Explorer</a> which also helps debug file and registry operations.</p>  <p>While this suite of tools is incredibly useful as it is they have now released online versions of them at <a title="http://live.sysinternals.com/" href="http://live.sysinternals.com/">http://live.sysinternals.com/</a> meaning that you can simply point your browser to that link and run any of the tools without installing it locally. </p>  <p>The main advantage here is that you don't have to keep updated as they release new versions.</p>  <p>I guess this is another example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">computing in the cloud</a>!</p>
