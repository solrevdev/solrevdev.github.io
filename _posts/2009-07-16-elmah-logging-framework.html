<p>Just stumbled across the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/" target="_blank">Error Logging and Handlers for ASP.NET</a> framework&#160; that is a
    logging framework for .NET that can be dropped into an already running website without the need for re-compilation or re-deployment.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/" target="_blank">Looks fantastic</a>. This is going into my side project as well!</p>
