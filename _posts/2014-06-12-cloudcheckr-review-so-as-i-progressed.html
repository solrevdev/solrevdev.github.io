So as I’ve progressed to living in the Visual Studio and Microsoft Windows eco system to using a Mac and Xamarin building cross platform apps to also being a head of devops and using the Amazon Web Services Cloud to setup 3 new start ups now there have been some tools and services that have stayed with me and improved and been a vital part of my toolbox.<br /><a href="http://cloudcheckr.com/">CloudCheckr</a> is one such tool and has come on in leaps and bounds since I started using it for a single use case back in the day so I thought I would post about this application and what it did for me then. I went from the free use teir to a paid one I think its that good even though I am just using it to monitor some personal projects.<br /><h2>Best Practices</h2>My first and still an important use case as I was getting to know AWS was best practises. Is my cloud setup secure, available and am I under or over usage?<br />This was and is still a very useful tool as it’s easy to forget to lock something down or forget that you fire up 1000 servers somewhere as a test.<br />Have I left ports open? Having a service send you best practises is worth every penny spent.<br /><br /><img alt="Best Practices" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.solrevdev.com/blog/cloudcheckr-best-practices.png" />  <br /><h2>Spend Optimization</h2>This was next up once I knew things were secure. Getting warning and potential cost savings especially important with start ups was invaluable.<br /><br /><img alt="Spend Optimisation" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.solrevdev.com/blog/cloudcheckr-spend.png" />  <br /><h2>More Features</h2>Since then they have added new features which are explained better on their website so I shall finish by just linking off to them and suggest you give them a free trial you will not be disappointed. <br /><br /><br /><a href="http://cloudcheckr.com/">Home Page</a><br /><br /><a href="http://cloudcheckr.com/cost-allocation/">Cost Allocation</a><br /><br /><a href="http://cloudcheckr.com/resource-reporting/">Resource Reporting</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A5OOLPgg6A">You Tube Video</a>
