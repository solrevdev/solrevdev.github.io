# GitHub blog hosting and tablet driven development #

My blog has moved platforms quite a bit over the years and is currently on blogger and was previously with a company and app that is no longer with us. So http://www.solrevdev.com sits on blogger, and I have a less techy more personal blog on Facebook which is https://www.facebook.com/thedrunkfist/

I have a lot of posts and content, and a custom domain and URLs that come up in search engines so moving away from blogger isn't going to be an insignificant task. So this is a test post to try out GitHub blog hosting, and the editor I am typing into now via my iPad and a wireless keyboard is TinyPress.

I am also looking at Linode not for hosting the blog but as a new way of working. 

I especially like the idea of being able to code and run most of my digital life on an iPad or mobile device or via a web browser.

So, for now, I am just using https://dnsimple.com/ to redirect http://johnsmithdoesnothaveawebsite.com here and using https://tinypress.co/ and https://codeanywhere.com/ to manage posts until I correctly migrate to https://jekyllrb.com/.

Let's see how this pans out!
