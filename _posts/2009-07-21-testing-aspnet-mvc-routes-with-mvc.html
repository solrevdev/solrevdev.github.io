<p>I am starting to make some progress with my side project that I am building out using ASP.NET MVC and SubSonic 3. </p>
<p>That said testing routes is something that I am not doing at the moment but has been nagging away at me especially when the application gets to a decent
    size.</p>
<p>Well it seems that <a href="http://ubiquitous-tech.blogspot.com/2009/07/test-aspnet-mvc-routes-using-mvc.html">the MVC Contrib project has something that can
        help me out here</a> (via a tweet from <a href="http://twitter.com/Dave_Bush">Dave Bush</a>).</p>
