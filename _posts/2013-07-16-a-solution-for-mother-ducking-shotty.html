Though you can persistently cancel out the corrections to <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/15/teach-iphone-autocorrect-new-words/">teach autocorrect</a> what you actually meant to type, you still might find particularly colorful words are continuously autocorrected to much friendlier variations, often involving animals, which if you're trying to sound a certain way can really take the oomph out of your intended words. </p>  <p><img title="iphone-mother-ducker" width="620" alt="Look at this mother ducker" src="http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/iphone-mother-ducker.jpg" height="425">  </p><p>If you really want to use certain words without the unintentional autocorrection, a solution of some sort is to use the keyboard replacement shortcuts feature to instantly swap a shortcut for another phrase. This will overcome the iOS dictionary preference for having a clean mouth, letting you be as filthy as you need to be.  </p><p>In this case, we'll replace that universally amusing and loved/hated "ducker" auto replacement with the "fudger" word that was actually intended (stick with the fudge or go with your more colorful preferred variation that we won't print here). </p>  <ul>  <li>Open Settings and go to "Keyboard", scroll down to "Shortcuts" and choose "Add New Shortcut…"  </li><li>In the "Phrase" section, put the word you actually meant to type (you meant "fudging", right?)  </li><li>In the "Shortcut" section, put the word persistently autocorrected, like "ducking"  </li><li>Choose "Save" and head to any text entry field, type out the original "ducking" word as intended and watch it replace itself with "fudging"  </li></ul>  <p><img title="ducking-autocorrect-fix" width="620" alt="Ducking Autocorrect fix" src="http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ducking-autocorrect-fix.jpg" height="415">  </p><p>Add additional shortcuts for more of your colorful autocorrection as needed, whether it's something "shotty" or a total "bass whole".  </p><p>Speaking of autocorrect, if you have persistently corrected errors or now have totally erroneous autocorrections, you can always <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/30/reset-autocorrect-iphone-ipad/">reset the dictionary</a> and start from scratch. </p>  <p><em>Thanks to Max for sending in the tip idea</em>  </p></div><div>        </div>  </div>  <br>  <div class="visit">  <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/osxdaily/~3/Ldh43kzhZE4/">Visit website</a>  </div>  </div>  <div class="footer">  Sent via <a href="http://bit.ly/SA6Efh">feedly</a> // A news reader for creative minds.  </div>    </div>
