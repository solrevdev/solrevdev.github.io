So this is just a little placeholder for a blog post I want to write about my transition from being a full-time developer and DevOps guy into being a full-time carer for my elderly mother and my brother who had a stroke. And how going teetotal learning how to box and clean eating has changed my life for the better.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I still like to program with C# but now using a Mac and Xamarin Studio, Write front-end code using sublime text and still like to play with Amazon Web services, technology like Docker, etc.</div><div></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue light&quot; , , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue light&quot; , , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I listen to podcasts about technology and software and still read lots of blogs about code infrastructure and all things development, tech and DevOps.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br /></div><div>But now I also subscribe to boxing and mixed martial arts podcasts and took a keen interest in fighting and clean eating and living.</div><div><br /></div><div>It has helped me physically and mentally, and I want to write a lengthier blog post about this when I have time.</div><div><br /></div><div>I haven't written a blog post for a very long time, so this will have to do for now!</div>
