I mostly code in [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) on either macOS or linux but on the occasion that I develop on windows I do like to use the old faithful Visual Studio.

And today I fixed an slight annoyance that I have with Visual Studio 2019.

If you cut or copy on a blank line accidently which does happen you will lose your clipboard contents.

To fix this in the search bar at the top enter `Apply Cut or Copy to blank lines when there is no selection` and open its's dialog.

Uncheck that box for your language (or all languages as I did).
