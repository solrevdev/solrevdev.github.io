<h1>Amazon Zocalo</h1>While busy coding away on some API endpoints and refactoring some code and making some schema changes, I realised I had not opened my email client all day and after a quick scan for anything requiring my immediate attention I noticed that Amazon had given me early access to the new Zocalo product.<br /><h2>First thoughts</h2>Initially I thought this is Dropbox with Sharepoint and that with web, mobile apps, Windows and Mac clients with promises of browser plugins this could be pretty cool.<br />“Amazon Zocalo is a fully managed, secure enterprise storage and sharing service with strong administrative controls and feedback capabilities that improve user productivity.”<br /><a href="http://youtu.be/wbjMrQtoZlU">Intro Video</a><br /><h2>Benefits</h2><ul><li>typical amazon storage in the cloud</li><li>low cost initially if you are a start up for example</li><li>easy to get started</li><li>most importantly active directory support</li></ul><h2>Active Directory</h2>Amazon Zocalo can integrate with your existing Active Directory. This means that your users can easily access Amazon Zocalo using their existing Active Directory credentials. This is a big win for the enterprise.<br /><h2>Amazon Workspaces</h2>Not 100 percent sure but when linked to Amazon Workspaces you could have a team all working on a Windows 7 experience with office apps and Zocola.<br /><h2>More later when not as busy!</h2>In the meantime have a read of the docs and look at some screenshots of the iPad app. Ok break over back to the code!<br /><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/zocalo/">Documentation</a><br /><em>Screenshots</em><br /><img alt="iPad Screenshot 1" src="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/zocola/1.jpg" />  <img alt="iPad Screenshot 2" src="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/zocola/2.jpg" />   <img alt="iPad Screenshot 3" src="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/zocola/3.jpg" />    <img alt="iPad Screenshot 4" src="http://static.solrevdev.com/blog/zocola/4.jpg" />
