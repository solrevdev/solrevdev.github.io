<h2>Hooked on Xamarin Studio / Monodevelop / ServiceStack</h2> <p>So one year later my indie subscription to the Xamarin Indie product was expiring . An ide to rival Microsoft Visual Studio, uses my language of choice c# and allows me to build web, console, services and apps all cross platform.</p> <p>It hurts paying for software sure but I am now more comfortable on a Mac in Xamarin building all sorts or cross platform goodness with .NET and just testing on a windows virtual machines.</p> <p>Add in the well thought out ServiceStack framework and various open source peojects and when my subscription reminder came round it was an easy decision to make.</p> <p>Compare to an MSDN license for example..</p> <p>The other thing of note was chatting to a WPF dev the other day and while we both loved MVVM and the language and various other Microsoft tooling, when i explained i was using the same language to deliver cross platform apps from a Mac and still getting a blank stare shows how much more Xamarin can offer.</p> <p>Big fan. you have my cash again this year as does ServiceStack</p>
